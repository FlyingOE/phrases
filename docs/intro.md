# Q Phrasebook



<big><big>==DRAFT==</big></big>

The phrasebook is a collection of q expressions used for common tasks. 

Q is a terse language. 
Phrases in q are often equivalent to library functions in other languages. 
They are useful tools for the programmer.
They are also illuminating guides to skilled use of the language, and repay study.

## Genealogy

The q phrases derive originally from the [FinnAPL Idiom Library](https://aplwiki.com/FinnAplIdiomLibrary), a legendary resource for programmers. 

Iverson’s reboot of APL was the [J programming language](https://jsoftware.com/), where the idioms became [phrases](https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Phrases).

[Eugene McDonnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_McDonnell) 
ported the FinnAPL Idiom Library to the k language. A partial translation of that into q was hosted – as an extraordinarily long page – on the old wiki.

## Paint the town red

The meaning of an idiom is given by customary usage. It cannot be understood by analysing the words in it. 

For example, people who set out to _paint the town red_ will not use paint of any color. They intend to go out and enjoy themselves. 

The Q Phrases can be understood by analysis. They reward study. 
So _phrases_, not _idioms_.
