# Q Phrasebook



<big><big>==DRAFT==</big></big>

The phrasebook is a collection of q expressions used for common tasks. 

Q is a terse language. 
Phrases in q are often equivalent to library functions in other languages. 
They are useful tools for the programmer.
They are also illuminating guides to skilled use of the language, and repay study.

## Genealogy

The q phrases derive originally from the [FinnAPL Idiom Library](https://aplwiki.com/FinnAplIdiomLibrary). 

Iverson’s reboot of APL was the [J programming language](https://jsoftware.com/), where the idioms became [phrases](https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Phrases).
(Idioms in English cannot generally be understood from the literal meaning of the words in them.)

[Eugene McDonnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_McDonnell) 
ported the FinnAPL Idiom Library to the k language. A partial translation of that into q was hosted – as an extraordinarily long page – on the old wiki.
