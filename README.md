The Q Phrasebook
================


A port of Eugene McDonnellâ€™s _K Idiom List_ to the q language.

See [`docs/introduction.md`](docs/introduction.md) for detail.

A project of the Kx Librarian librarian@kx.com.




Plan of work
------------

Unlike the unusably long page on the old Kx Wiki, the phrases need grouping into **categories** to help students navigate. (See Issue #2.) 

The plan is to construct a **1-page index** of phrases. 


### Discussion pages

Many phrases merit examples and discussion. 
For these, we write **discussion pages** and link to them from the index table. 

Related phrases can appear on the same discussion page.
For example, ascending and descending sorts of sublists should appear on the same page. 

Discussion pages are the place to write about performance, alternative expressions, and when to use them. 


### Numbering

The index table shows the numbers from the old wiki page. 
This will remain useful until the k idioms have been translated. 
Then we need our own numbering scheme. (See Issue #3.)
